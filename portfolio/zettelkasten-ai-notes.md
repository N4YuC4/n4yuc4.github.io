# Zettelkasten AI Notes

A desktop application built with `PyQt5` for efficient knowledge management using the Zettelkasten method. It allows users to create, edit, and link notes, supports `Markdown` for rich content, and provides a real-time preview. It stores all data in a local `SQLite` database. A key feature is its ability to use `Google Gemini AI` to generate Zettelkasten-style notes from PDF documents and automatically suggest relevant links between them.

## Key Features

*   **Intuitive User Interface:** A clean and responsive `GUI` for seamless note management.
*   **Note Creation and Management:** Easily create, save, rename, and delete individual notes.
*   **Markdown Support with Live Preview:** Write your notes in `Markdown` and see the generated output in real-time.
*   **Categorization:** Organize notes into custom categories for better filtering and navigation.
*   **AI-Powered Note Generation from PDF:** Extract text from PDF documents and use `Google Gemini AI` to automatically generate Zettelkasten-style notes with suggested relevant links.
*   **Mind Map Visualization:** View your notes and their links as an interactive mind map. This helps you visualize relationships between your ideas and navigate your knowledge base more effectively.
*   **Smart Note Linking:** Create explicit links between notes to build a rich, interconnected graph of your knowledge.
*   **Theming:** Choose between light and dark themes to customize the application's appearance.
*   **SQLite Database:** Robust and reliable local storage for all your notes and their relationships.
