        "description": "A desktop application built with PyQt5 for efficient knowledge management using the Zettelkasten method. It allows users to create, edit, and link notes, supports Markdown for rich content, and provides a real-time preview. It stores all data in a local SQLite database. A key feature is its ability to use Google Gemini AI to generate Zettelkasten-style notes from PDF documents and automatically suggest relevant links between them.",
